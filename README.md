Dotfiles
================

## Contents

-   [`etc`](#etc)
-   [`.config`](#config)
-   [`.local`](#local)

These are my dotfiles that I personally use.

## `etc`

The `/etc/` directory contains global configuration files and
directories. The main ones you will find in this repository are for
Portage (Gentooâ€™s package manager).

## `.config`

The `~/.config/` directory is a directory in the home directory for
configuration files and directories. Here you will find my
configurations for almost all of the software I use.

## `.local`

The `~/.local/` directory is a shared local directory in the home
directory. The only valuable things I have here are my simple shell
scripts in the `bin/` subdirectory.
